# Trees
Create a BinaryTree class

## Challenge
1. Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
2. Create a BinaryTree class (Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately)
3. Create a BinarySearchTree class :
- Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
- Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once

## Approach & Efficiency
- preOrder()  O(n)
- InOrder()  O(n)
- PostOrder() O(n)
- add() O(logn)
- contains() O(logn)
