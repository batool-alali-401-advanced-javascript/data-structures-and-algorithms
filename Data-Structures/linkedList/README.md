# Linked List
a program to  Create a linked list with insert method, includes and toString to insert an element, search for an element and print all elements.

## Challenge
creating two classes named node and linkedlist which has a constructor and three methodes:

- method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
- method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
- a method called toString which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List,

## Approach & Efficiency
- insert O(1)
- includes O(logn)
- toString O(n)
