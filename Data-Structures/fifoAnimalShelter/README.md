# Animal Shelter
Implemented a FIFO animal shelter.

## Challenge
Create an AnimalShelter using first-in-first-out for dog or cat animal. Implement enqueue and dequeue methods.
## Approach & Efficiency
Created a Node and Animal class. Used the concept of queues for FIFO. 
* Methods:

1. enqueue - Time and Space complexities: 0(1). Add using back pointer.
2. dequeue - Time complexity: 0(n) and Space Complexity: 0(1). Iterate through the list using current and previous pointers.
